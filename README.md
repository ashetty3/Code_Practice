Creating a daily practice log where I let capture data for four dimensions: 
1. Time taken to read the question
2. Time taken to answer the question
3. Claude's rating on my conceptual understanding
4. Claude's rating on accuracy

I also capture incidents where Claude responses are not really compregensive and work with it to arrive at the ideal solution.
